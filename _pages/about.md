I'm currently a second year PhD. student at Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego, where I am fortunately advised by Prof. Hao Su. Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Yao Class, Tsinghua University. 

I worked as a research intern at Hillbot Inc. (2024&2025 summer), and I was also a research intern at UC San Diego, supervised by Prof. Zhuowen Tu (2023 spring&summer).

**Research Interest**: My research interests lies on the intersection of **Robotics**, **computer vision** and **Maching Learning**, with particular focus on sim-to-real robot manipulation and generative models.

I'm seeking for research colloboration as well as 2026 summer intern opportunities, please feel free to contact me via e-mail (yiw215 [at] ucsd [dot] edu).
